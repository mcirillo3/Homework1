# Homework1
This python file was a file I made for my first homework assignment for my Big Data Analytics course.
I first introduce a variable called "text" that is a string variable that states that this code will be used for my first homework assignment. I then print the "text variable".

Next I assign a variable called "number" the value 24.
I then use an if statement to see if the "number" variable is greater than 8, and if it is greater than 8, the code should
print out that the number is greater than 8. If the number variable is not greater than 8, the code should print out that the number is 
less than or equal to 8.
